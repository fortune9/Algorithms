Learning notes on algorithms
======

This repository hosts the implementations of different algorithms.
There are two purposes for creating this repository:

1. Help me to recall these algorithms in case I need to reimplement
   them in my research.
2. If possible, help others to understand the algorithms.

I learned a lot from a Coursera course [_Algorithm: Design and
Analysis_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis/).
I highly recommend this course to anyone who has some programming
experience and wants to design better algorithms.

## Implemented Algorithms
Each implemented algorithm is placed in a folder. For example, the
folder *Karatsuba* contains the implementation of Karatsuba algorithm
of integer multiplication.

Folder | Description 
-------|-------------------------------
[count\_inversions](Algorithms/count_inversions.py)|using MergeSort algorithm to count the number of inversions in an array
[Karatsuba](Algorithms/karatsuba_int_multiplication.py)|integer multiplication using [Karatsuba algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm)
[quick sort](Algorithms/quick_sort)|quick sort algorithm implementation

Your feedback is always welcome!
