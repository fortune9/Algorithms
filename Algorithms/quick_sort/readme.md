# quick sort algorithm implementation

In this folder, the quick sort algorithm has been implemented.
Depending on how the pivot is chosen, the algorithm may be implemented
in different ways. The method I used in each program is listed below:

file name | pivot choosing method
----------|----------------------
quick\_sort1.py|pivot is randomly chosen
test.in|example input file
test.out|example output file
readme.md|this readme file

The input file, like test.in, can contains more than one number in a
line, but the numbers can only be delimited by white spaces such as
tab or ' '.
